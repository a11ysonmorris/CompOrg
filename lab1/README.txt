Lab 1 - README

Student names: Allyson Morris & Krishna Swaminathan

Effort distribution: 45% 50% (Allyson: Q1, Q2, Q3 + README + Krishna: Q4, Q5)

Total time: 6 hours

Comments:
- Learned how to use gdb commands more effectively
- The cipher in Part 3 was more confusing, as we had to use pointers instead of array subscripts.
- It was really interesting to see how reversing words while keeping non-alphabetic characters in place worked out.

Directions for runnin:
Part 1: Only produces lab1p1.txt writeup (no executable required).
Part 2: 
    gcc -o lab1p2q1 lab1p2q1.c
    ./lab1p2q1
    gcc -o lab1p2q2 lab1p2q2.c
    ./lab1p2q2
Part 3:
    gcc -o lab1p3 lab1p3.c
    ./lab1p3
    (reads from lab1p3in, writes to lab1p3out)
