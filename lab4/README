How to run (on CS lab machine with multilib installed):
1) Compile assembly:
   gcc -m32 -o sos-by-hand sos-by-hand.s
   ./sos-by-hand 3 4

2) Generate assembly from C:
   gcc -m32 -S sos.c      # creates sos.s
   gcc -m32 -o sos-from-assembly sos.s
   ./sos-from-assembly 3 4

3) Generate optimized assembly:
   gcc -S -O3 -m32 -o sos_O3.s sos.c
   gcc -m32 -o sos-O3 sos_O3.s
   ./sos-O3 3 4

Notes/issues:
- I ran the Y86 steps on an online simulator since the lab tools on my machine required additional libraries.
- Observations: GCC -O3 optimized sq and sos by reducing frame setup and using register arithmetic.
