Student name(s): Your Full Name
Effort distribution: 100% (I worked alone)
Total time spent: X hours

How to run (on CS lab machine with multilib installed):
1) Compile hand-written assembly:
   gcc -m32 -o sos-by-hand sos-by-hand.s
   ./sos-by-hand 3 4

2) Generate assembly from C:
   gcc -m32 -S sos.c      # creates sos.s
   gcc -m32 -o sos-from-assembly sos.s
   ./sos-from-assembly 3 4

3) Generate optimized assembly:
   gcc -S -O3 -m32 -o sos_O3.s sos.c
   gcc -m32 -o sos-O3 sos_O3.s
   ./sos-O3 3 4

4) (Optional) Y86: Tested sos.ys on an online Y86 simulator (name: <write which one>).
   Files included: sos.ys (source), sos.yo (assembled output).

Notes / issues:
- I ran the Y86 steps on an online simulator since the lab tools on my machine required additional libraries.
- Observations: GCC -O3 optimized sq and sos by reducing frame setup and using register arithmetic.
